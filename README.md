# RGB LED Color Changer with Button â€“ Arduino

This project implements an **RGB LED control system** using an **Arduino or ESP32**, where pressing a button **cycles through different colors**.

- Each **button press changes the LED color**.
- The system cycles through **8 different colors** before turning **off** the LEDs and restarting.
- The **button uses an internal pull-up resistor** to detect presses.
- Works with **Arduino IDE**.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno / ESP32**
- **RGB LED (Common Cathode or Three Separate LEDs)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Push Button**
- **Breadboard**

## How It Works
1. The **button is pressed**, triggering the next color in the sequence.
2. The system **cycles through the colors** 
3. **After 8 presses**, the LEDs turn off, and the cycle restarts.
